We are a not for profit social enterprise focussing on the objective of increasing the number of women involved in the field of data science and artificial intelligence. 

This is our primary mission; we do it to help address the gender imbalance in tech industries and to enable women/non binary individuals to fulfil their potential regardless of their background.

What we do:
- We host tutorials, workshops and discussions
- We partner with companies to offer support for our events and to engage their DS staff through our volunteer instructor programme


scholarships for bootcamps, courses and conferences to our members.
